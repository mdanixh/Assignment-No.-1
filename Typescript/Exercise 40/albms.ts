// Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds an Object describing a music album. 
//The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information.
//Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the 
//album information correctly. Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. 
//If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call
// that includes the number of tracks on an album.

          //or absent in the album object.
